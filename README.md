This is my first ever published program, so it's not that good. I will be making this more user friendly as well as adding a ton more features in the future (Idk how to do strikethrough in GitHub readme, but this project is kinda abandoned until Gooboo gets more updates)

I'm too lazy to do the licenses shit, so just do whatever you like ig, but I would appreciate it if you don't just re-upload my code without making _some_ changes
